<h1>MSKLC Guide</h1>

<p>This guide is not an introduction to the basic features of MSKLC, the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. The application is straightforward enough for most people to be able to understand it by playing around with it. Instead, I would like to spread information about lesser-known functionalities.</p>

<h2 id="0">How to install the latest version of MSKLC</h2>
<p>Everything to follow assumes you have MSKLC's latest version installed, which, at the time of writing (and probably for the rest of time) is version 1.4.6000.2</p>
  <p>To check MSKLC's version, select "Help" in the menu, and then go on "About".</p>
